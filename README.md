# GRU-based-molecular-generators
In this demo, gated recurrent unit (GRU)-based recurrent neural network (RNN) combined with transfer learning is used to model the molecular generation of OX1R inhibitors. In addition, machine learning (ML) based predictors with graph convolutional networks (GCN) were also used for molecular activity prediction.
